STL<!--more--> 

The Standard Template Library (STL) is a set of C++ template classes to provide common programming data structures and functions such as lists, stacks, arrays, etc. It is a library of container classes, algorithms, and iterators. It is a generalized library and so, its components are parameterized. A working knowledge of [template classes](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/templates-cpp/) is a prerequisite for working with STL.

**STL has four components**

- Algorithms
- Containers
- Functions
- Iterators
